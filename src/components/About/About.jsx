                I am 21 years and started getting interested in programming when I was 14.
                Then I decided I wanted to work developing software apps. When I finally got my hands
                onto coding, I learned about web development and loved it.

                I started with The Odin Project to learn the basics and then jumped into CS50x Harvardâ€™s
                course. I tend to vary a lot my learning sources and am always trying to update my knowledge
                in any topic I learn to improve my code and practices.
            </p>
            <p>
                I finally took a programming course which included transversal skills and fully dove into 
                web development where I learned client-server model and the use of technologies like 
                Bootstrap, Sass, Node, Express and asynchrony in JavaScript, as well as the use of the fetch and localStorage APIs.
